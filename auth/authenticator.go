	// Authenticate verifies r's credential (its Authorization header or
	// cookie, and any sender proof) and returns its Verified, or nil and an
	// error. It checks live: a credential whose sign-in was revoked, or whose
	// account is banned or deleted, is refused, not admitted until a token
	// expires. It admits people and applications alike.
	//
	// Its error matches ErrUnauthenticated when r carries no valid
	// credential, joined with ErrExpired, ErrRevoked or
	// ErrSenderProofRequired when that is why; ErrForbidden for a valid
	// credential the provider refuses here; ErrUnavailable when it could not
	// verify. It may be a *Challenge carrying the provider's headers.
	//
	// It is safe for concurrent use. A consumer calls it at most once per
	// request (a sender proof is spent once) and keeps the Verified for that
	// request alone; a provider whose own middleware already verified r's
	// credential reuses that verification.

// PermissionChecker is an optional capability of a Verified request. Can
// reports whether the request holds exactly permission (never a pattern) in
// exactly scope, checked live and without verifying the request again: a
// scope of another authority, or of a group the credential is not bound to,
// is false, and the credential's ceilings hold. Consumers deny privileged
// access without this capability; identity metadata never implies a grant.

// policy, checked without verifying the request again. Otherwise its error
// matches ErrStepUpRequired when the person must sign in again (a *Challenge
// gives the policy's MaxAge and the provider's Metadata); ErrExpired or
// ErrRevoked (with ErrUnauthenticated) when the credential ended;
// ErrForbidden for a credential with no sign-in of its own (an
// application's, an API key); ErrUnavailable when the check could not run.

// token or a trusted issuer's token for its group, and the zero Scope when
// it is bound to none, as a person's own sign-in is. A bound credential's
// Can is false outside it. A consumer serving one scope's resources admits
// there only a credential bound to that scope; without this capability a
// credential is bound to none.
